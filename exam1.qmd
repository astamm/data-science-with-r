set is available in the {palmerpenguins} package. You can install the package

## Goal

The goal of this exam is to reproduce the following plot using the `penguins`
data set:

Hint: You need to carefully analze the plot to understand how you need to
manipulate the original data set in order to get the correct answer. For the
sake of clarity, *with fixed slopes* means that the slopes of the lines are the
same for all species and sexes. *with varying slopes* means that the slopes of
the lines are different for each species and sex.
